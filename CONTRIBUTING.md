# Contributing:
Contributions in the form of Pull Requests are always welcome! I am happy to review code submissions and consider implementing them into the baseline.

# Rules: 
Please just remember that I am one person and so my ability to review may be slow. 
Please also remember that any Pull Requests must include a description of the problem or feature that it is trying to solve/implement, as well as best-effort
commenting on changes.
